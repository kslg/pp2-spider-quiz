What I can suggest is to use bootstrap modals - https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.6/components/modal/
I don't know if you are using Bootstrap in your project but is great to use as it already has styles included and also you don't have to write the JavaScript

Make sure you have the correct attributes so that when you either click a button or an event is happening. Also make sure you are not reusing id's twice that may conflict.
Currently I cannot see the modal at all on your site when I finish the game so it could also be the styling you are implementing in your javascript.
This is a jquery resource but it shows you if you want to programmatically trigger a modal : https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_ref_js_modal.asp
Another resource about alternative modals:
https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_modal.asp
Hope this helps, as I said feel free to look at these suggestions and reach out with a new ticket when you have tried them
